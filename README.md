**Football Match Outcome Prediction Web App**

This is a web application built using Flask that predicts the outcome of football matches based on historical data. The prediction model is trained using a neural network implemented with TensorFlow/Keras. Users can select two teams from a dropdown menu, and the application will provide the predicted probabilities of each team winning or the match ending in a draw.

**Instructions**

1. **Installation**

   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required Python packages by running:
     ```
     pip install flask tensorflow scikit-learn pandas matplotlib
     ```
   - Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary data file named 'E0.csv' in the same directory as the Python script.

2. **Running the Application**

   - Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
   - Run the following command:
     ```
     python app.py
     ```
   - This will start the Flask development server.
   - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the web application.

3. **Usage**

   - Upon accessing the web application, you will see two dropdown menus containing a list of football teams.
   - Select the home team and the away team for which you want to predict the match outcome.
   - Click the "Predict" button.
   - The application will display the predicted probabilities of each team winning or the match ending in a draw, along with some historical match data between the selected teams.

**Files**

- `app.py`: This is the main Python script that contains the Flask application code, model training, and prediction functions.
- `index.html`: This HTML template file contains the structure and layout for the web interface.
- `E0.csv`: This CSV file contains historical football match data used for training the prediction model.

**Notes**

- The prediction model is trained using a neural network implemented with TensorFlow/Keras.
- The historical match data is preprocessed to extract relevant features and encoded for model training.
- The application provides predictions based on the trained model's output probabilities.
- Additional information about the match history between the selected teams is displayed for reference.

**Disclaimer**

- This application provides predictions based on historical data and a machine learning model. The predictions should be considered as estimates, and actual match outcomes may vary.
- The accuracy of the predictions depends on various factors, including the quality and quantity of the training data and the performance of the prediction model.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or encounter any issues while running the application.
